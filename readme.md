# Gorilla Tag Mod Template

Template for PCVR Gorilla Tag Mods


The template creates the following files of note:
* [Plugin.cs](GorillaTagModTemplateProject/Plugin.cs): The main class of your mod. Most of your code should go here.
* [PluginInfo.cs](GorillaTagModTemplateProject/PluginInfo.cs): This holds information about your plugin in a central location. This is where the plugin name, id, and version are stored.
* [HarmonyPatches.cs](GorillaTagModTemplateProject/HarmonyPatches.cs): This handles the application of harmony patches (such as ExamplePatch). You shouldn't need to modify this class.
* [Patches/ExamplePatch.cs](GorillaTagModTemplateProject/Patches/ExamplePatch.cs): This demonstrates how patches are created, you should remove or modify it as you see fit.
* [MakeRelease.ps1](GorillaTagModTemplateProject/MakeRelease.ps1): This script generates a [MonkeModManager New UI](https://github.com/The-Graze/MonkeModManager) or [MonkeModManager Old UI](https://github.com/NgbatzYT/MonkeModManager) compatible release (named ModName-v.zip). You should use this to create builds that you share with others.
* [Directory.Build.props](GorillaTagModTemplateProject\Directory.Build.props): This file contains information about where dependencies are located. If you are getting CS024 (type could not be found) errors, GamePath is probably wrong.
